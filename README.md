## Build

To generate the posters, simply run:

    $ make

In order for the build process to be successful, you will need the following:

* LaTeX
* The `beamerposter` and `cclicences` LaTeX packages and their dependencies (if you installed texlive you may already have these installed)
* `imagemagick` to build the thumbnail images
* Make

You can install [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) in Ubuntu by running `sudo apt-get install texlive`. Mac users may try [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/), and the preferred distribution for Windows is [MikTeX](http://www.miktex.org/). If you don't have make, you should be able to compile it manually with the `pdflatex` command or similar means.
