            HTTP status codes are returned in the response. They each consist of
            a three digit numerical code and a text description (the text
            description is simply advisory, and may be translated to other
            languages). The codes are categorized such that general classes of
            errors have the same most-significant digit, so if a client does not
            recognize a status code it may still infer the code's category.

        303 See Other & The resource has been found, and should be accessed using a GET method. Added in HTTP/1.1 to clarify the ambiguity in the behavior of status 302. See 302 and 307 \\

        305 Use Proxy & The resource should be accessed through a specified proxy \\
